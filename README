Put cats.pl and Cat.pm in the same directory and run cats.pl:

./cats.pl

You can specify a number of times for the simulation to be run by
providing a numeric argument to the script, like this:

./cats.pl 30

The default number of runs is 1, and so the average doesn't really
mean much of anything.
